First Odin Project

10.20.22 I'll be learning to code and demonstrate my skills with HTML. I'm excited for this first project as I 
have taken a 3 to 4 week pause from coding to work on Company Projects. 

10-28-22 Cont.

Getting this show on the road this is my first assignment and I'm looking forward to growing my
Git + Git commit skills as well as any other skill to be learned in this lesson.
I've been dragging this on so I'm soooo ready to get it done and move on to the next session!

GO TIME !
